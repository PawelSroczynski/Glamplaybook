## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 The Challenge

Enklava Yurts operates as a successful craft business building custom yurts. The ambition is to scale this into an international franchise operation. However, the current operational model is fundamentally **person-dependent** rather than **system-dependent**.

### 1.2 Core Diagnosis

> **Current State:** The business works because YOU do it.
> **Problem:** You cannot "copy and paste" yourself to another country.

The existing client flow (Jurta v3.0) represents a **craftsman's workflow**, not a **franchise-ready business system**. While effective for current operations, it lacks the documentation, standardization, quality controls, and technological infrastructure required for replication.

### 1.3 Key Findings

| Aspect | Current Score | Franchise-Ready Score |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Process Clarity | 7/10 | Needs 9/10 |
| Completeness | 4/10 | Needs 9/10 |
| Scalability | 2/10 | Needs 8/10 |
| Franchise-Readiness | 2/10 | Needs 8/10 |

### 1.4 Primary Recommendation

Before pursuing international expansion, the business must prove its systems work **without the founder** - first in Poland, with 2-3 people trained from zero using documented systems only.

---

## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Client Flow Overview

The Jurta v3.0 flowchart documents the following stages:

```
ATTENTION → ENGAGEMENT → ENQUIRY → SALES → MONEY → ORDERS → PRODUCTION → DELIVERY → ASSEMBLY → REPEAT
```

#### 2.1.1 Customer Acquisition Channels
- Private Facebook profile
- Yurt building group (Facebook)
- Enklava Yurts Facebook profile
- Private personal chats with friends

#### 2.1.2 Engagement to Enquiry Path
```
Facebook/Messenger → WhatsApp → Onboarding Multimedia
```

#### 2.1.3 Sales Process
```
Client Needs Definition → Full-Service → Customised Proposal → Agreement → Invoice
```

#### 2.1.4 Order Components
- Windows, doors, skylight
- Connectors
- Canvases

#### 2.1.5 Production Streams (Parallel)
1. **Wooden Structure** - Frame construction
2. **Sewing Covers** - Canvas and cover production
3. **Insulation Shaping** - Thermal layer preparation

#### 2.1.6 Fulfillment
```
Shipping to Construction Site → On-Site Assembly → Customer Satisfaction → Repeat Business
```

### 2.2 Strengths of Current Model

| Strength | Business Value |
|----------|----------------|
| Clear stage progression | Easy to understand workflow |
| Multi-channel acquisition | Multiple lead sources |
| Full-service approach | Higher ticket value |
| Customer satisfaction focus | Repeat business potential |
| Personal relationships | High trust, high conversion |

### 2.3 Fundamental Limitations for Scaling

| Limitation | Impact on Franchise |
|------------|---------------------|
| Person-dependent lead generation | Cannot transfer personal networks |
| Undocumented processes | Cannot train new operators |
| No quality checkpoints | Inconsistent output quality |
| No metrics/KPIs | Cannot benchmark franchisees |
| High customization | Difficult to standardize |
| Implicit knowledge | Critical know-how in founder's head |

---

## 3. Critical System Gaps

### 3.1 Gap #1: Knowledge Layer (CRITICAL)

**What's Missing:**

| Element | Description | Franchise Impact |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) | Step-by-step instructions for every process | New franchisee doesn't know HOW to do each step |
| Quality Checklists | Inspection criteria at each stage | No quality control = inconsistent output across locations |
| Document Templates | Contracts, proposals, invoices | Everyone does it differently = legal chaos |
| Technical Knowledge Base | Materials specs, construction methods, troubleshooting | How to sew a cover? What wood to use? What insulation? |

**Consequence:** If the founder disappears tomorrow, the business dies.

**Required Deliverables:**
- [ ] 15-20 Standard Operating Procedures (with video)
- [ ] Quality checklist per production stage
- [ ] Template library (contracts, proposals, invoices)
- [ ] Technical manual with specifications

---

### 3.2 Gap #2: Quality Gates (CRITICAL)

**Current Flow Problem:**
```
Enquiry → Sales → Production → Delivery → Assembly → Done
```

**Missing Checkpoints:**

| Stage | Required Quality Gate | Purpose |
|-------|----------------------|---------|
| Post-Design | Customer approval of specifications | Prevent production of wrong product |
| Pre-Shipping | Quality inspection of all components | Catch defects before delivery |
| Post-Assembly | Technical acceptance test | Verify structural integrity |
| Handover | Customer sign-off document | Legal protection, satisfaction confirmation |

**Franchise Risk:** One bad assembly in Germany = reputation damage for entire brand across all markets.

**Required Deliverables:**
- [ ] Quality gate definitions for each stage
- [ ] Inspection checklists
- [ ] Sign-off document templates
- [ ] Non-conformance handling procedures

---

### 3.3 Gap #3: Metrics and KPIs (HIGH)

**Unanswered Questions:**

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| What is the conversion rate from Enquiry → Sales? | Benchmark for franchisee performance |
| How long does Production take? | Capacity planning, delivery promises |
| What % of customers return (Repeat)? | Business health indicator |
| What is Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)? | Marketing budget allocation |
| What is the margin per yurt? | Franchise fee calculation basis |
| What is the average order value? | Revenue forecasting |
| What is the defect rate? | Quality benchmarking |

**Without Metrics:**
- No benchmarks for franchisees to hit
- No way to identify problems early
- No basis for optimization
- No data for franchise disclosure documents

**Required Deliverables:**
- [ ] KPI dashboard definition
- [ ] Data collection processes
- [ ] Benchmarking standards
- [ ] Reporting templates

---

### 3.4 Gap #4: Personal-Dependent Acquisition Channels (HIGH)

**Current Channels:**
```
private Facebook profile → conversation tete-a-tete → personal chats with friends
```

**Why This Doesn't Scale:**

1. **Network Non-Transferability:** A franchisee in Spain doesn't have YOUR friends
2. **Profile Ownership:** Cannot "hand over" a personal Facebook profile
3. **Brand Fragmentation:** No central brand building
4. **Lead Attribution:** Cannot track which channels perform best

**Required Transformation:**

| From (Current) | To (Franchise-Ready) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Personal Facebook | Branded company pages |
| Messenger chats | CRM-integrated chat |
| Word of mouth | Referral program with tracking |
| Personal network | SEO + Paid advertising |
| Ad-hoc content | Content marketing calendar |

**Required Deliverables:**
- [ ] Brand guidelines and assets
- [ ] CRM system implementation
- [ ] Marketing playbook for franchisees
- [ ] Lead generation templates (ads, landing pages)
- [ ] Referral program structure

---

### 3.5 Gap #5: Customization vs. Standardization Tension (HIGH)

**Current Approach:** "Customised Proposal"

**Franchise Requirement:** "Standardized Packages with Options"

**The Dilemma:**

| Too Much Customization | Too Little Customization |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Impossible to replicate | Loss of competitive advantage |
| Requires expert knowledge | Commoditized product |
| Longer sales cycles | May not meet customer needs |
| Higher error risk | Easier to train and scale |

**Resolution: Modular Configuration Model**

```
BASE MODELS (3-5 standard sizes)
    ├── Small (4m diameter)
    ├── Medium (5m diameter)
    ├── Large (6m diameter)
    ├── XL (7m diameter)
    └── Custom (requires HQ approval)

OPTIONS (Standardized Add-ons)
    ├── Window packages (A, B, C)
    ├── Door styles (Standard, Premium)
    ├── Insulation levels (Basic, Enhanced, Arctic)
    ├── Cover materials (Canvas, Premium Canvas, All-Weather)
    └── Interior packages (None, Basic, Luxury)
```

**Required Deliverables:**
- [ ] Product matrix definition
- [ ] Configuration rules
- [ ] Pricing model per configuration
- [ ] Online configurator specification

---

### 3.6 Gap #6: Responsibility Assignment (MEDIUM)

**Current State:** Undefined - founder does everything or delegates ad-hoc.

**Franchise Question:** Who is responsible for each step?

| Stage | Currently | In Franchise Model - Option A | Option B |
|-------|-----------|------------------------------|----------|
| Lead Generation | Founder | Franchisee responsibility | HQ provides leads |
| Sales | Founder | Franchisee | HQ closes, franchisee delivers |
| Production | Founder/Team | Local production | Central production |
| Assembly | Founder/Team | Local certified team | HQ traveling team |

**Required Deliverables:**
- [ ] RACI Matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
- [ ] Franchise model decision (see Section 6)
- [ ] Role descriptions
- [ ] Training requirements per role

## 6. Strategic Questions to Resolve

Before proceeding with franchise development, the following strategic decisions must be made:

### 6.1 Production Model

**Question:** Where will yurts be produced?

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Central (Poland exports)** | Quality control, expertise concentration | Shipping costs, lead times, customs |
| **Local (Franchisee produces)** | Lower logistics cost, faster delivery | Training intensive, QC challenge, equipment investment |
| **Hybrid (Components central, assembly local)** | Balance of control and flexibility | Complex coordination |

**Recommended Approach:** Start with Central, evolve to Hybrid as franchise matures.

### 6.2 Sales Model

**Question:** Who owns the customer relationship?

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **HQ generates leads, franchisee closes** | Consistent brand, economies of scale | Franchisee dependency, lead quality disputes |
| **Franchisee generates and closes** | Local market knowledge, motivated franchisee | Inconsistent brand, variable quality |
| **Shared (HQ brand, franchisee local)** | Combined strengths | Complex attribution, potential conflicts |

**Recommended Approach:** Shared model with clear territory definitions and lead source tracking.

### 6.3 Assembly Model

**Question:** Who performs on-site assembly?

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Certified local installers** | Scalable, lower cost | Training investment, QC challenge |
| **HQ traveling team** | Consistent quality, expertise | High cost, scheduling constraints |
| **Customer self-assembly** | Lowest cost, scalable | Support burden, liability risk |
| **Hybrid (complex=HQ, simple=local)** | Flexibility | Complexity in decision criteria |

**Recommended Approach:** Certified local installer program with HQ supervision for first 3-5 assemblies per franchisee.

### 6.4 Customization Scope

**Question:** How much customization is allowed?

| Level | Description | Implication |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **None** | Fixed models only | Easy to scale, limited market |
| **Low** | Standard models + predefined options | Balanced, recommended starting point |
| **Medium** | Modifications within parameters | Requires approval process |
| **High** | Full custom (founder involvement) | Premium pricing, limited scale |

**Recommended Approach:** Low customization standard, Medium available with HQ approval, High only direct from HQ.

### 6.5 Revenue Model

**Question:** How will HQ generate revenue from franchisees?

| Component | Options | Consideration |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Initial Fee** | €20K-100K | Market-dependent, covers training |
| **Royalty** | 4-8% of revenue | Ongoing support funding |
| **Marketing Fund** | 1-2% of revenue | Central marketing activities |
| **Product Markup** | 10-30% on supplies | If HQ supplies materials |
| **Training Fees** | Per person/course | Ongoing certification |

**Recommended Approach:** Initial fee + Royalty + Marketing fund. Product markup optional based on production model.

### 6.6 Territory Structure

**Question:** How will territories be defined?

| Approach | Description | Consideration |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Exclusive geographic** | Country/region exclusivity | Clear, but may limit growth |
| **Non-exclusive** | Multiple franchisees per area | Competition risk |
| **Performance-based** | Exclusivity tied to targets | Motivation, but complexity |
| **Master franchise** | Sub-franchising rights | For large markets |

**Recommended Approach:** Exclusive geographic for initial markets, Master franchise for large countries (Germany, UK, France).

##### Phase B: First Assembly Pilot (March 2026)

**Objective:** Validate all SOPs and checklists in real conditions.

| Activity | Pilot Test Focus | Documentation |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Pre-assembly | Logistics SOP, shipping checklist | Time log, issues encountered |
| Site prep | ASSY-001 validation | Photos, deviation notes |
| Frame erection | ASSY-002 validation, tool list accuracy | Video recording, timing |
| Cover install | ASSY-003 validation | Quality checkpoint photos |
| Handover | Customer sign-off process | Customer feedback form |

**Pilot Metrics to Capture:**

| Metric | Target | Actual | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| SOP adherence rate | 100% | ___ | Steps followed vs. improvised |
| Time variance | ±20% | ___ | Actual vs. estimated |
| Quality gate pass rate | 100% | ___ | First-time passes |
| Customer satisfaction | >8/10 | ___ | Post-handover survey |
| Issues requiring founder | 0 | ___ | Escalations |

**Post-Pilot Debrief:**
- [ ] What worked exactly as documented?
- [ ] What required improvisation?
- [ ] What was missing from SOPs?
- [ ] What would a new person struggle with?
- [ ] Update all documents based on findings

##### Phase C: Batch Assembly Pilots (April-May 2026)

**Objective:** Prove repeatability with 3 consecutive assemblies.

| Assembly | Focus | Success Criteria |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| #2 (April) | Consistency test | Same process, same results |
| #3 (April/May) | Efficiency test | Reduced time, fewer issues |
| #4 (May) | Independence test | Minimal founder involvement |

**Franchise Readiness Indicators:**

| Indicator | Assembly #2 | Assembly #3 | Assembly #4 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| SOP deviations | Target: <5 | Target: <3 | Target: 0 |
| Time improvement | - | +10% faster | +15% faster |
| Founder hours | Baseline | -25% | -50% |
| Quality consistency | Same as #1 | Same | Same |

#### 7.6.4 Pilot Success Criteria

By end of May 2026, the following must be true:

**Documentation Complete:**
- [ ] 8+ production SOPs validated in real use
- [ ] 4+ assembly SOPs validated through 4 assemblies
- [ ] 4+ quality checklists with pass/fail data
- [ ] Video documentation of key processes
- [ ] Quick reference cards for field use

**Systems Validated:**
- [ ] Quality gates enforced on all 4 assemblies
- [ ] Checklists completed 100%
- [ ] Customer sign-off collected 100%
- [ ] All issues documented and SOPs updated

**Metrics Established:**
- [ ] Baseline timing for all production processes
- [ ] Baseline timing for assembly process
- [ ] Customer satisfaction benchmark (target: >8.5/10)
- [ ] Defect/issue rate established

**Scalability Demonstrated:**
- [ ] At least one assembly completed with <4 hours founder involvement
- [ ] All SOPs understandable without verbal explanation
- [ ] No critical knowledge only in founder's head

#### 7.6.5 Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Documentation delays during busy production | Dedicated 2 hours/day for documentation |
| Assembly issues overshadow documentation | Assign documentation observer role |
| Customer pressure conflicts with pilot rigor | Set customer expectations upfront |
| Perfectionism delays progress | "Good enough to train" standard, iterate later |

#### 7.6.6 Investment Required

| Category | Items | Estimated Effort |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| Documentation | SOP writing, photos, diagrams | 40-60 hours |
| Video | Recording, basic editing | 20-30 hours |
| Checklists | Creation and formatting | 10-15 hours |
| Pilot observation | Note-taking during assemblies | 4 hours × 4 = 16 hours |
| Iteration | Post-pilot updates | 20-30 hours |
| **Total** | | **~110-150 hours** |

> **Note:** This investment pays dividends immediately - documented processes reduce future training time, reduce errors, and enable delegation.
